Description: Estimate the lifetime risk of developing and dying from cancer,
        as well as age conditional probabilities, using data from Population
        Based Cancer Registries. Four distinct methods are implemented,
        including the Adjusted for Multiple Primary method (AMP), the 'current
        probability' method, the Devan method suggested by SEER, and the
        traditional cumulative risk with a predefined upper age limit.
